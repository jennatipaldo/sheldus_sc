# About
This repository provides code to analyze publicly available SHELDUS data for South Carolina.  This is example code that was created for workshops held by the virtual [Center for Aging, Climate, and Health (CACHE)](https://agingclimatehealth.org/).

## Data Source
The data that this code analyzes is for publicly available data from SHELDUS (the Spatial Hazard Events and Losses Database for the United States), a county-level dataset for the United States with information on natural hazards, including events, type of hazard, losses, injuries, and fatalities.
